# DeepSeek Harness Desktop

An unofficial community desktop shell for the public
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) agent runtime.

`dsh` is a command-line agent runtime that also serves a full web UI. This project wraps
that runtime in a desktop application: it starts the kernel as a local child process,
waits until it is genuinely serving, and shows its UI in a hardened window — so the
runtime can be launched by double-clicking rather than from a terminal.

> **Status: early development.** The kernel itself is an upstream developer preview
> (`0.1.0-rc.x`) whose configuration surface is still changing. Windows and macOS
> (Apple Silicon and Intel) are the platforms that have been built end to end; see
> [Roadmap](#roadmap) for the rest.

# DeepSeek Harness Desktop  (Deepin / UOS / Linux x86_64 build)

This is a **Deepin / UOS / Linux x86_64 build** of the community
[DeepSeek Harness Desktop](https://github.com/sleep2agi/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop)
shell. The upstream project targets Windows and macOS; this fork keeps the same
Electron shell intact and adds a Linux packaging path (`deb` + `AppImage`) with
all of the upstream's security, readiness, and process-tree policies preserved.

## About this fork

Everything in this repository is adapted from — and built on top of — two
upstream projects. Both are public, both use pinned public dependencies, and
neither is being forked or vendored here:

- **deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness** — the `dsh` kernel and web UI.
  <https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness>
- **sleep2agi/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop** — the Electron desktop shell for
  Windows and macOS, on top of which this Linux build is based.
  <https://github.com/sleep2agi/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop>

The Linux-only differences from upstream are:

1. `upstream.lock.json` adds a `linux-x64` Node runtime entry, checksum-verified
   against nodejs.org, so the kernel is still run on a real Node build rather
   than Electron-as-Node.
2. `tools/install-kernel.js` swaps `node-pty` to a release that still ships its
   Linux native source, since upstream `node-pty@1.1.0` removed its `src/unix/`
   sources and `npm rebuild` fails on Linux without intervention.
3. `tools/after-pack.js` validates that the bundled `node` binary is present in
   the packaged `resources/kernel/` on Linux, as it already does for Windows
   and macOS.
4. `package.json` `build.linux` config adds `deb` and `AppImage` targets with
   the runtime deps a Deepin installation needs.

## Shipped plugins

Out of the box the shell installs a small set of community plugins into every
user's profile, so the bundled application is useful from the first launch
rather than starting as an empty runtime. The list is pinned in
[`upstream.lock.json#shippedPlugins`](upstream.lock.json); today:

| Plugin | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `dshmarket` | A visual plugin market inside the kernel UI — browse, search, and one-click install community plugins, no terminal needed. |

The build pipeline (`tools/install-kernel.js`) lays each shipped plugin into
`resources/kernel/node_modules/<name>/` at install time, and the shell
registers it into the user's profile on first launch (`src/main.js`,
`ensureShippedPlugins`). The kernel resolves bundles from both the
installation anchor and the user's profile, so a plugin installed at build
time is reachable from any user without each user having to fetch it
themselves — and once registered, the user can update or remove it from
inside the kernel UI without touching the bundled copy.

Adding a new shipped plugin is a two-step commit:

1. Add the package name, version, and `sha512` integrity from npm to
   `upstream.lock.json#shippedPlugins` so the install step verifies what
   landed on disk.
2. Re-run `npm run kernel:install`. The plugin is fetched alongside the
   kernel and gets picked up on the next launch by the auto-discovery in
   `ensureShippedPlugins` — no shell code change is required.

## Linux-only features added on top of upstream

- **OS menu bar, kept.** The chat UI is still driven entirely by the rendered
  web surface, but the menu bar is no longer removed: `src/app-menu.js` builds
  a real application menu (应用 / 文件 / 编辑 / 视图 / 窗口), matching the
  official shell, which documents that Linux keeps the application and Edit
  menus. Its first item opens Electron's native **About** panel with the app
  icon, product name and installed version. DevTools is registered as two
  *hidden* entries so **F12** and **Ctrl+Shift+I** work in packaged builds
  without advertising them. `autoHideMenuBar: true` keeps the bar out of the
  way until Alt is pressed.
- **Directory-picker fallback.** The official shell falls back to browse mode
  when Linux has neither `zenity` nor `kdialog`, because Electron's native
  folder dialog shells out to one of them and silently does nothing without
  it. `src/directory-picker.js` probes `PATH` and selects the picker;
  `kernel.directoryPicker` in `config.json` can pin it to `auto`/`browse`/`native`.
- **Crash reports.** `src/diagnostics.js` writes `crash-<UTC>-<source>.log` to
  the platform log directory — `logs` under `userData` on Linux and Windows —
  and keeps the most recent ten, replacing the old unbounded `kernel-exit.log`
  and `startup-error.log`.
- **Denied web permissions.** The page in the window is the kernel's web UI, not
  shell code, so `src/permissions.js` refuses camera, microphone, clipboard and
  notification requests rather than letting Chromium prompt.
- **Remembered window geometry.** `src/window-state.js` restores the size and
  position the user last left, reusing a saved position only when enough of the
  window would still be visible on a connected display.
- **Configurable key bindings.** Overrides live in `userData/keybindings.json`,
  separate from `DSH_HOME`. On Linux a binding is delivered by dispatching into
  the document, not by intercepting the keystroke — the official shell documents
  the same split, and it is what keeps editing and IME input working.
- **Exit confirmation.** `src/exit-guard.js` decides whether quitting prompts
  first. **This is the one place this shell knowingly differs from upstream**:
  the official shell asks its Host what quitting would interrupt, over a private
  IPC channel that belongs to its private Desktop Host package. This shell has
  no such channel, so the policy is declared in `kernel.exitPolicy`
  (`ask-always` by default) rather than derived.
- **System tray + hide-to-tray.** `src/tray.js` registers an Electron `Tray`
  with a Show/Hide/Quit menu; clicking the X on the main window hides it
  instead of quitting, and the kernel keeps running in the background. An
  explicit Quit (tray menu or `before-quit`) is what tears the whole app down.
- **Background-completion toast.** `src/dom-observer.js` is injected via
  `webContents.executeJavaScript` after every page load and uses a
  `MutationObserver` to watch the kernel's web UI for an in-flight indicator
  (`aria-busy="true"`, `data-state="generating"`, `思考中` / `生成中`, and the
  `dsh-generating` / `dsh-thinking` / `dsh-streaming` class names). The
  busy → idle transition fires a desktop notification through the shell.
- **In-page desktop controls.** The `dsh-deepin-controls` plugin under
  [`plugins/`](plugins/dsh-deepin-controls) adds a small floating **桌面工具**
  panel inside the web UI that mirrors the tray's actions — restart kernel,
  check for updates, toggle autostart, About, hide window, quit — plus a live
  status line. It is mounted the same way the official shell mounts its own
  controls: a bundle whose `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, inserted
  through the profile's patch layer. Nothing about it needs the official
  private Desktop Host package.

  The preload stays narrow: the page calls `shell.invoke(name)` with an action
  *name* only, and the main process looks it up in `DESKTOP_ACTIONS`
  (`src/desktop-commands.js`) and refuses anything else. The page cannot reach
  an IPC handler this shell did not mean to expose, and the state pushed back
  to it is reduced to a phase, a busy flag and the autostart flag — no paths,
  tokens or log lines.

Everything above is the upstream web UI, served by the kernel and rendered in the shell's
window. The shell contributes the window, the process, and the security policy around
them — not the interface — with the one exception of the in-page controls above, which
the shell expressly allows through a fixed allowlist.

## What this is, and what it is not

This repository contains **only the desktop shell**. All agent behaviour — models, tools,
sessions, permissions, the web UI — comes from the upstream kernel and its plugins.

The shell owns four things, and deliberately nothing else:

| Concern | What the shell does |
|---|---|
| **Process** | Starts `dsh` as a child process on a free port, and shuts down the whole process tree on exit. |
| **Readiness** | Waits for a real HTTP response from *this* launch before showing a window. |
| **Window** | Applies a fixed security policy: sandboxed renderer, exact-origin navigation allowlist, `http`/`https`-only external links. |
| **Configuration** | Expresses its preferences as a patch overlay, through the kernel's own supported mechanism, without modifying upstream code. |

Nothing upstream is patched or vendored-and-edited. The kernel is installed from npm at a
pinned version, and every shell preference goes through `--patch`, which is a first-class
part of the launcher's configuration layering.

## Design notes

A few decisions that are easy to get wrong, and why this shell makes them the way it does.

**An open port is not a ready server.** The kernel's web server binds its port during
startup, and a plugin failing afterwards can still bring the process down. In that window
a TCP connection succeeds while nothing is being served, and a window pointed at it shows
a blank page. Readiness therefore requires a real HTTP 2xx/3xx response.

**Readiness is bound to one launch.** Every probe attempt re-checks that the process being
waited on is still the current one. Otherwise a kernel that died and left its port to
another program on the machine would answer the probe perfectly well — with someone else's
server.

**Navigation is compared as an exact origin.** `startsWith('http://127.0.0.1:')` also
matches any other service running locally, and `includes('127.0.0.1')` matches
`http://evil.example/?x=127.0.0.1`. The loaded page decides its own links; the shell does
not get to assume they are benign.

**Secrets are redacted as they enter the log buffer,** not as they leave it. Redacting at
read time still leaves the plaintext sitting in this process's memory until then. The
matching is by shape and cannot be complete — it is a second line of defence, not a
guarantee.

**The kernel gets its own `DSH_HOME`,** and every inherited `DSH_*` variable is dropped.
Sharing a home directory with a `dsh` the user installed themselves would have the two
overwrite each other's configuration, and would put the user's own stored credentials
within reach of this process.

**Telemetry is switched off explicitly.** Upstream already defaults it to disabled; the
shell states it anyway, so the default is a property of this application rather than of
whichever kernel version happens to be bundled.

**The kernel runs on its own bundled Node, not on Electron's.** Those are different
runtimes, and the difference is not theoretical. With an identical kernel and an identical
configuration, launched under Electron-as-Node the kernel aborts during startup:

```
failed to apply loader entry … (@deepseek-ai/cordis-plugin-hmr):
  --expose-internals is required for HMR service
```

and on a stock Node build of the same major version it starts cleanly. Notably this
happens *after* the web server is already answering HTTP — so even a real HTTP response is
not proof that the process will stay up, which is why an unexpected kernel exit is
reported rather than silently leaving a window pointed at nothing.

The bundled runtime is downloaded from nodejs.org, checked against the SHA-256 published
in that release's `SHASUMS256.txt`, and then asked what version it is. Both checks fail the
build rather than warn.

**What ships is not what npm installs.** An npm tree is published for developers: debug
symbols, source maps, the TypeScript the JavaScript was built from, documentation, and
prebuilt binaries for every platform. None of it is opened by a running application, and
all of it would ship to every user — 180 MB of the installed size. `tools/prune-kernel.js`
removes it, keeping licences and notices in every spelling, since redistributing
MIT-licensed code without its licence text is a violation. The end-to-end test runs against
the pruned kernel, so a size win that broke startup fails the build.

## Download and install

Release builds are published on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/westanke/dsh-desktop-deepin/releases). Two Linux
formats are produced:

| Format | Covers | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `*.deb` | Debian / Ubuntu / **UOS / Deepin** / Kylin | Installs into `/opt`, registers a launcher and an icon |
| `*.AppImage` | any Linux x86_64 | No installation; make it executable and run it |

**Use `apt`, not `dpkg -i`, to install the deb.** `dpkg` installs without resolving
dependencies and will fail on a machine missing any of the runtime libraries this build
declares (`libgtk-3-0`, `libnotify4`, `libnss3`, `libxss1`, `libxtst6`, `xdg-utils`,
`libatspi2.0-0`, `libayatana-appindicator3-1`); `apt` fetches them and completes cleanly:

```sh
sudo apt install ./DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop-<version>-amd64.deb
```

On Deepin/UOS, a newly installed launcher may ask whether to trust the application on
first launch; confirm it. Trust is recorded per-user, so a launcher that appears to do
nothing on the first double-click is usually this prompt, not a failure.

To remove it again:

```sh
sudo apt remove deepseek-harness-desktop
```

Your Harness home (`~/.dsh` or `$DSH_HOME` — sessions, settings, credentials, plugins) is
**not** touched by uninstalling; only the application and its Electron user data go.

### Building the packages yourself

Packaging is not automatic — GitHub Actions only runs what a workflow tells it to. The
workflow lives at [`ci/package-linux.yml`](ci/package-linux.yml); it calls
`electron-builder` on `ubuntu-latest` and collects the artifacts. Move it to
`.github/workflows/` to enable it, or run the same command locally:

```sh
npm ci
npm test
npm run kernel:install
npx electron-builder --linux deb --linux AppImage --publish never
```

Artifacts land in `release/`.

## Requirements

**To run a packaged build:** nothing. The kernel and its Node runtime are inside the
installer.

**To develop:** Node.js ≥ 22.15.0 — the kernel uses `zlib.createZstdDecompress`, which does
not exist in earlier versions.

Windows and macOS ship a bundled, checksum-verified Node runtime, so a packaged build has
no external requirements. Linux is expected to work but has not been exercised, and still
falls back to the system Node.

This build also supports **system-kernel mode**: point `DSH_KERNEL_BIN` at an
already-installed `dsh` and the shell drives that instead of the bundled kernel — no
bundled download, and the kernel version is whatever you have installed. See
`launcher.systemDsh` and `kernel.homeSubdir` in [`config.json`](config.json).

## Development

```sh
npm install          # shell dependencies (Electron, builder, types)
npm test             # unit tests for every load-bearing decision — no network, no Electron
npm run kernel:install   # fetch the pinned kernel into resources/kernel
npm start            # launch the shell against it
npm run dist:mac     # signed-ad-hoc .dmg and .zip for this Mac
npm run dist:win     # NSIS installer and .zip for Windows
```

The kernel version is pinned in [`upstream.lock.json`](upstream.lock.json), which is the
single source of truth for it. Upgrading is an explicit commit, not something a rebuild
does on its own — upstream is a developer preview and documents that it will make
breaking changes.

### Layout

Load-bearing *decisions* live in plain modules with no Electron or filesystem imports, so
they can be tested directly:

| Module | Decides |
|---|---|
| `src/window-policy.js` | Where the window may navigate; what may be handed to the OS. |
| `src/kernel-runtime.js` | The kernel's argument vector and environment. |
| `src/readiness.js` | When the kernel counts as ready. |
| `src/log-redact.js` | What may enter the log buffer, and how much is kept. |
| `src/restart-policy.js` | Whether a dead kernel gets another attempt, and after how long. |
| `src/directory-picker.js` | Whether the native folder dialog can be trusted on this platform. |
| `src/app-menu.js` | The OS menu bar's structure, including the About panel. |
| `src/shortcuts.js` | Which bindings are accepted, and how one is delivered. |
| `src/window-state.js` | Whether a remembered size and position can be reused. |
| `src/exit-guard.js` | Whether quitting should prompt first. |
| `src/diagnostics.js` | Where a crash report goes, and how many are kept. |
| `src/config-file.js` | How a shell configuration file is written without tearing. |

`src/main.js` does IO and orchestration only.

## Roadmap

- [x] Kernel launch, argument and environment construction
- [x] Readiness probe bound to a single launch
- [x] Window and navigation security policy
- [x] Bounded, redacted log capture
- [x] Bundled, checksum-verified Node runtime
- [x] Windows installer, verified by launching it and loading the UI
- [x] macOS build (Apple Silicon and Intel runtimes; `.dmg` + `.zip`)
- [ ] Linux builds
- [ ] Workspace picker fix — the native picker crashes on Windows in the current kernel
      preview; `buildShellPatch({ useBrowseDirectoryPicker: true })` selects the non-native
      implementation, and it is not enabled by default yet

### macOS notes

Packaged builds are ad-hoc signed, not notarized. A download from the internet will be
quarantined by Gatekeeper. Right-click the app and choose Open, or:

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/DeepSeek Harness Desktop.app"
```

A Mac launched from the Dock has a minimal `PATH`. The shell prepends Homebrew's usual
locations (`/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`) so the kernel can still find `git` and
the rest of a developer toolchain.

## Independence

Everything here is written from public sources against pinned public dependencies. It does
not copy private product code, and contains no organization-specific branding,
authentication clients, private endpoints, update feeds, credentials, or telemetry. The
`scan:leaks` check in CI enforces this against the working tree and the committed history,
and fails the build rather than warning.
